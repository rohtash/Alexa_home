Fauxmo README
=============

|Build Status|

Python 3 module that emulates Belkin WeMo devices for use with the
Amazon Echo.

Originally forked from https://github.com/makermusings/fauxmo, unforked
to enable GitHub code search (which currently doesn't work in a fork),
and because the libraries have diverged substantially.

-  Documentation:
   `fauxmo.readthedocs.org <https://fauxmo.readthedocs.org>`__

Introduction
------------

The Amazon Echo is able to control certain types of home automation
devices by voice. Fauxmo provides emulated Belkin Wemo devices that the
Echo can turn on and off by voice, locally, and with minimal lag time.
Currently these Fauxmo devices can be configured to make requests to an
HTTP server or to a `Home Assistant <https://home-assistant.io>`__
instance via `its Python
API <https://home-assistant.io/developers/python_api/>`__ and only
require a JSON config file for setup.

As of version v0.4.0, Fauxmo uses several API features and f-strings
that require Python 3.6+. I highly recommend looking into
`pyenv <https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv>`__ if you're currently on an
older Python version and willing to upgrade. Otherwise, check out the
FAQ section at the bottom for tips on installing an older Fauxmo version
(though note that I will not be continuing development or support for
older versions).

Terminology
-----------

faux (``\ˈfō\``): imitation

WeMo: Belkin home automation product with which the Amazon Echo can
interface

Fauxmo (``\ˈfō-mō\``): Python 3 module that emulates Belkin WeMo devices
for use with the Amazon Echo.

Fauxmo has a server component that helps register "devices" with the
Echo (which may be referred to as the Fauxmo server or Fauxmo core).
These devices are then exposed individually, each requiring its own
port, and may be referred to as a Fauxmo device or a Fauxmo instance.
The Echo interacts with each Fauxmo device as if it were a separate WeMo
device.

Usage
-----

Installation into a venv is *highly recommended*, especially since it's
baked into the recent Python versions that Fauxmo requires.

Simple install: From PyPI
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. ``python3 -m venv venv``
2. ``source venv/bin/activate``
3. ``python3 -m pip install fauxmo``
4. Make a ``config.json`` based on
   ```config-sample.json`` <https://github.com/n8henrie/fauxmo/blob/master/config-sample.json>`__
5. ``fauxmo -c config.json [-v]``

Simple install of dev branch from GitHub
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is a good strategy for testing features in development -- for
actually contributing to development, clone the repo as per below)

1. ``python3 -m venv venv``
2. ``source venv/bin/activate``
3. ``pip install [-e] git+https://github.com/n8henrie/fauxmo.git@dev``

Install for development from GitHub
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. ``git clone https://github.com/n8henrie/fauxmo.git``
2. ``cd fauxmo``
3. ``python3 -m venv venv``
4. ``source venv/bin/activate``
5. ``pip install -e .[dev]``
6. ``cp config-sample.json config.json``
7. Edit ``config.json``
8. ``fauxmo [-v]``

Set up the Echo
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Open the Amazon Alexa webapp to the `Smart
   Home <http://alexa.amazon.com/#smart-home>`__ page
2. **With Fauxmo running**, click "Discover devices" (or tell Alexa to
   "find connected devices")
3. Ensure that your Fauxmo devices were discovered and appear with their
   names in the web interface
4. Test: "Alexa, turn on [the kitchen light]"

Set fauxmo to run automatically in the background
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

NB: As discussed in
`#20 <https://github.com/n8henrie/fauxmo/issues/20>`__, the example
files in ``extras/`` are *not* included when you install from PyPI\*
(using ``pip``). If you want to use them, you either need to clone the
repo or you can download them individually using tools like ``wget`` or
``curl`` by navigating to the file in your web browser, clicking the
``Raw`` button, and using the resulting URL in your address bar.

\* As of Fauxmo v0.4.0 ``extras/`` has been added to ``MANIFEST.in`` and
may be included somewhere depending on installation from the ``.tar.gz``
vs ``whl`` format -- if you can't find them, you should probably just
get the files manually as described above.

systemd (e.g. Raspbian Jessie)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1. Recommended: add an unprivileged user to run Fauxmo:
   ``sudo useradd -r    -s /bin/false fauxmo``

   -  NB: Fauxmo may require root privileges if you're using ports below
      1024

2. ``sudo cp extras/fauxmo.service /etc/systemd/system/fauxmo.service``
3. Edit the paths in ``/etc/systemd/system/fauxmo.service``
4. ``sudo systemctl enable fauxmo.service``
5. ``sudo systemctl start fauxmo.service``

launchd (OS X)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1. ``cp extras/com.n8henrie.fauxmo.plist ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.n8henrie.fauxmo.plist``
2. Edit the paths in
   ``~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.n8henrie.fauxmo.plist``

   -  You can remove the ``StandardOutPath`` and ``StandardErrorPath``
      sections if desired

3. ``launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.n8henrie.fauxmo.plist``
4. ``launchctl start com.n8henrie.fauxmo``

Plugins
-------

Plugins are small user-extendible classes that allow users to easily
make their own actions for Fauxmo to run by way of Alexa commands. They
were previously called Handlers and may be referred to as such in places
in the code and documentation.

Fauxmo v0.4.0 implements a new and breaking change in the way Handlers
were implemented in previous versions, which requires modification of
the ``config.json`` file (as described below).

A few plugins and the ABC from which the plugins are required to inherit
are included and installed by default in the ``fauxmo.plugins`` package.
The pre-installed plugins, like the rest of the core Fauxmo code, have
no third party dependencies.

The pre-installed plugins include

-  ``fauxmo.plugins.simplehttpplugin.SimpleHTTPPlugin``
-  ``fauxmo.plugins.command_line.CommandLinePlugin``

``SimpleHTTPPlugin`` responds to Alexa's ``on`` and ``off`` commands by
making requests to URL endpoints by way of
```urllib`` <https://docs.python.org/3/library/urllib.html>`__. Example
uses cases relevant to the IOT community might be a Flask server served
from localhost that provides a nice web interface for toggling switches,
whose endpoints could be added as the ``on_cmd`` and ``off_cmd`` args to
a ``SimpleHTTPPlugin`` instance to allow activation by way of Alexa ->
Fauxmo.

Please see details regarding ``SimpleHTTPPlugin`` configuration in the
class's docstring, which I intend to continue as a convention for Fauxmo
plugins. Users hoping to make more complicated requests may be
interested in looking at ``RESTAPIPlugin`` in the
```fauxmo-plugins repository`` <https://github.com/n8henrie/fauxmo-plugins>`__,
which uses Requests for a much friendlier API.

User plugins
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Users can easily create their own plugins, which is the motivation
behind most of the changes in Fauxmo v0.4.0.

To get started:

1. Decide on a name for your plugin class. I highly recommend something
   descriptive, CamelCase and a ``Plugin`` suffix, e.g.
   ``FooSwitcherPlugin``.
2. I strongly recommend naming your module the same as the plugin, but
   in all lower case, e.g. ``fooswitcherplugin.py``.
3. Note the path to your plugin, which will need to be included in your
   ``config.json`` as ``path`` (absolute path recommended, ``~`` for
   homedir is okay).
4. Write your class, which should at minimum:

   -  inherit from ``fauxmo.plugins.FauxmoPlugin``.
   -  provide the methods ``on()`` and ``off()``.

5. Any required settings will be read from your ``config.json`` and
   passed into your plugin as kwargs at initialization, see below.

In addition to the above, if you intend to share your plugin with
others, I strongly recommend that you:

-  Include generous documentation as a module level docstring.
-  Note specific versions of any dependencies in that docstring.
-  Because these user plugins are kind of "side-loaded," you will need
   to manually install their dependencies into the appropriate
   environment, so it's important to let other users know exactly what
   versions you use.

Notable plugin examples
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

NB: You may need to *manually* install additional dependencies for these
to work -- look for the dependencies in the module level docstring.

-  https://github.com/n8henrie/fauxmo-plugins

   -  ``RESTAPIPlugin``

      -  Trigger HTTP requests with your Echo.
      -  Similar to ``SimpleHTTPPlugin``, but uses
         `Requests <https://github.com/kennethreitz/requests>`__ for a
         simpler API and easier modification.

   -  ``HassAPIPlugin``

      -  Uses the `Home Assistant Python
         API <https://home-assistant.io/developers/python_api/>`__ to
         run commands through a local or remote Home Assistance
         instance.

   -  ``CommandLinePlugin``

      -  Run a shell command on the local machine.

   -  User contributions of interesting plugins are more than welcome!

Configuration
-------------

I recommend that you copy and modify
```config-sample.json`` <https://github.com/n8henrie/fauxmo/blob/master/config-sample.json>`__.
Fauxmo will use whatever config file you specify with ``-c`` or will
search for ``config.json`` in the current directory, ``~/.fauxmo/``, and
``/etc/fauxmo/`` (in that order). The minimal configuration settings
are:

-  ``FAUXMO``: General Fauxmo settings

   -  ``ip_address``: Optional[str] - Manually set the server's IP
      address. Recommended value: ``"auto"``.

-  ``PLUGINS``: Top level key for your plugins, values should be a
   dictionary of (likely CamelCase) class names, spelled identically to
   the plugin class, with each plugin's settings as a subdictionary.

   -  ``ExamplePlugin``: Your plugin class name here, case sensitive.

      -  ``path``: The absolute path to the Python file in which the
         plugin class is defined (please see the section on user plugins
         above). Required for user plugins / plugins not pre-installed
         in the ``fauxmo.plugins`` subpackage.
      -  ``example_var1``: For convenience and to avoid redundancy, your
         plugin class can *optionally* use config variables at this
         level that will be shared for all ``DEVICES`` listed in the
         next section (e.g. an api key that would be shared for all
         devices of this plugin type). If provided, your plugin class
         must consume this variable in a custom ``__init__``.
      -  ``DEVICES``: List of devices that will employ ``ExamplePlugin``

         -  ``name``: Optional[str] -- Name for this device. Optional in
            the sense that you can leave it out of the config as long as
            you set it in your plugin code as the ``_name`` attribute,
            but it does need to be set somewhere. If you omit it from
            config you will also need to override the ``__init__``
            method, which expects a ``name`` kwarg.
         -  ``port``: Optional[int] -- Port that Echo will use connect
            to device. Should be different for each device, Fauxmo will
            attempt to set automatically if absent from config. NB: Like
            ``name``, you can choose to set manually in your plugin code
            by overriding the ``_port`` attribute (and the ``__init__``
            method, which expects a ``port`` kwarg otherwise).
         -  ``example_var2``: Config variables for individual Fauxmo
            devices can go here if needed (e.g. the URL that should be
            triggered when a device is activated). Again, your plugin
            class will need to consume them in a custom ``__init__``.

Each user plugin should describe its required configuration in its
module-level docstring. The only required config variables for all
plugins is ``DEVICES``, which is a ``List[dict]`` of configuration
variables for each device of that plugin type. Under ``DEVICES`` it is a
good idea to set a fixed, high, free ``port`` for each device, but if
you don't set one, Fauxmo will try to pick a reasonable port
automatically (though it will change for each run).

Please see
```config-sample`` <https://github.com/n8henrie/fauxmo/blob/master/config-sample.json>`__
for a more concrete idea of the structure of the config file, using the
built-in ``SimpleHTTPPlugin`` for demonstration purposes. Below is a
description of the kwargs that ``SimpleHTTPPlugin`` accepts.

-  ``name``: What you want to call the device (how to activate by Echo)
-  ``port``: Port the Fauxmo device will run on
-  ``on_cmd``: str -- URL that should be requested to turn device on.
-  ``off_cmd``: str -- URL that should be requested to turn device off.
-  ``method``: Optional[str] = GET -- GET, POST, PUT, etc.
-  ``headers``: Optional[dict] -- Extra headers
-  ``on_data`` / ``off_data``: Optional[dict] -- POST data
-  ``user`` / ``password``: Optional[str] -- Enables HTTP authentication
   (basic or digest only)

Security considerations
-----------------------

Because Fauxmo v0.4.0+ loads any user plugin specified in their config,
it will run untested and potentially unsafe code. If an intruder were to
have write access to your ``config.json``, they could cause you all
kinds of trouble. Then again, if they already have write access to your
computer, you probably have bigger problems. Consider making your
config.json ``0600`` for your user, or perhaps
``0644 root:YourFauxmoUser``. Use Fauxmo at your own risk, with or
without user plugins.

Troubleshooting / FAQ
---------------------

-  How can I increase my logging verbosity?

   -  ``-v[vv]``

-  How can I ensure my config is valid JSON?

   -  ``python -m json.tool < config.json``
   -  Use ``jsonlint`` or one of numerous online tools

-  How can I install an older / specific version of Fauxmo?

   -  Install from a tag:

      -  ``pip install git+git://github.com/n8henrie/fauxmo.git@v0.1.11``

   -  Install from a specific commit:

      -  ``pip install   git+git://github.com/n8henrie/fauxmo.git@d877c513ad45cbbbd77b1b83e7a2f03bf0004856``

-  Where can I get more information on how the Echo interacts with
   devices like Fauxmo?

Installing Python 3.6 with `pyenv <https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code:: bash

    sudo install -o $(whoami) -g $(whoami) -d /opt/pyenv
    git clone https://github.com/yyuu/pyenv /opt/pyenv
    echo 'export PYENV_ROOT="/opt/pyenv"' >> ~/.bashrc
    echo 'export PATH="$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
    echo 'eval "$(pyenv init -)"' >> ~/.bashrc
    source ~/.bashrc
    pyenv install 3.6.1

You can then install Fauxmo into Python 3.6 in a few ways, including:

.. code:: bash

    # Install with pip
    "$(pyenv root)"/versions/3.6.1/bin/python3.6 -m pip install fauxmo

    # Show full path to fauxmo console script
    pyenv which fauxmo

    # Run with included console script
    fauxmo -c /path/to/config.json -vvv

    # I recommend using the full path for use in start scripts (e.g. systemd, cron)
    "$(pyenv root)"/versions/3.6.1/bin/fauxmo -c /path/to/config.json -vvv

    # Alternatively, this also works (after `pip install`)
    "$(pyenv root)"/versions/3.6.1/bin/python3.6 -m fauxmo.cli -c config.json -vvv
